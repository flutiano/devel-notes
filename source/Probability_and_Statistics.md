### Introductory: Probability Only
**A First Course in Probability**, __Ross__, 8ed, PH, 545p, 2010

* intended as an elementary introduction to the theory of probability for students in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and the sciences (including computer science, biology, the social sciences, and management science) 
* who possess the prerequisite knowledge of elementary calculus
* start from __Combinatorial Analysis__


Elementary Probability for Applications, Durrett, 252p, 2009

* one-semester course in probability that was taken by __math majors__ and students from other departments


Understanding Probability, Henk Tijms, 3e, 574p, __2012__

* The first part of the book demystifies probability and uses __many wonderful probability applications__ from everyday life
* The second part, covering a wide range of topics, teaches clearly and simply the basics of probability.
* The 2nd part requires a basis course in calculus.


Introduction to probability, 2e, __MIT__ - Dimitri P. Bertsekas and John N. Tsitsiklis, 539p, 2008

* with solution manual
* some of the more mathematically rigorous analysis has been just sketched or intuitively explained in the text
* covers the fundamentals of probability theory (probabilistic models, discrete and continuous random variables, multiple random variables, and limit theorems)
* most notable omission in coverage is an introduction to statistics


A Natural introduction to probability theory, Ronald Meester, 204p

* Not based on measure theory
* for __math majors__
* Discrete -> continuous


Introduction to Probability Models, Sheldon __Ross___9e, 801p, 2007

* elementary probability theory and stochastic processes
* how probability theory can be applied to the study of phenomena in fields such as engineering, computer science, management science, the physical and social sciences, and operations research
* __heuristic and nonrigorous__ and attempts to develop in the student an intuitive feel for the subject which enables him or her to “think probabilistically.”
* __one-year__ course in probability models


### Probability and Statistics
**Probability and Statistics**, DeGroot,.Schervish, 4ed, CMU, 911p, 2012

* somewhat long for complete coverage in a one-year course at the undergraduate level
* somewhat difficult and for math students


Mathematical.Statistics.with.Applications, 2008

* 1-year sequence of courses 
* present a solid undergraduate foundation in statistical theory while providing an indication of the relevance and importance of the theory in solving practical problems in the real world

### Data and Engineering Focused
Probability, Statistics, and Random Processes for Engineers, 4e, 859p, 2012

* less mathematical than the measure theory approach but more rigorous than formula and recipe manuals
* The Web site includes an extensive set of small MATLAB programs that illustrate the concepts of probability


**Probability and statistics for Engineers & Scientists**, 9e, Walpole, Myers, Myers and Ye, 812p, 2012

* designed for either a one- or a two-semester course
* Students have had the equivalent of one semester of differential and integral calculus. Linear algebra is helpful. 


A Modern Introduction to Probability and Statistics - Understanding Why and How, 485p, 2005

* A first course in calculus is needed as a prerequisite
* aimed at undergraduate __engineering students__, and students from more business-oriented studies
* designed for a one-semester course


Statistics and Probability for Engineering Applications With Excel - W.J. DeCoursey, 416p, 2003

* suitable as a textbook on statistics and probability for engineering students.


Introduction to Probability and Statistics 13th - Mendenhall, Beaver, 777p, 2009

* basic level


Introduction to Business Statistics 7ed- Weiers, 892p, 2011

* including review of probability theory concepts


Statistics for Business and Economics-11e, 1071p, 2011

Introduction to the Practice of Statistics - 6ed, 1010p, 2009

* including review of probality theory
* __elementary__ in mathematical level, but __conceptually rich in statistical ideas__ and aim to help students think about data and use statistical methods with understanding.


Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis, 3e, 885p, 2008

* a traditional treatment of probability and probability distributions at an introductory level
* focus on the __data analysis process__
